1. Make 2 tables from 2 csv files college_Exp_2013 and enrollments_2013

2. Here make new table taking the input from already existing tables created in above steps and perform some arithmetic operations: 
CREATE TABLE Get_the_Fees row format delimited fields terminated by ',' STORED AS RCFile
AS select unitid, institution_name, drvic2013_rv_tuition_and_fees_2013_14, 
(drvic2013_rv_total_price_for_out_of_state_students_living_on_campus_2013_14 - drvic2013_rv_tuition_and_fees_2013_14) AS Living_Cost_ON_Campus, drvic2013_rv_total_price_for_out_of_state_students_living_off_campus_not_with_family_2013_14 AS Living_Cost_Off_Campus_Without_Family, 
drvic2013_rv_total_price_for_out_of_state_students_living_off_campus_with_family_2013_14 AS Living_Cost_Off_Campus_With_Family,
hd2013_state_abbreviation AS State, hd2013_level_of_institution AS Level_of_institution
from college_exp_2013;


3. Now create new table taking input from table created in step 2 and joining this table to enrollment_2013 table created in step 1: 
CREATE TABLE Fees row format delimited fields terminated by ',' STORED AS RCFile 
AS select Get_the_fees.unitid, enrollments_2013.institution_name, Get_the_fees.state, enrollments_2013.drvef2013_total_enrollment, 
drvic2013_rv_tuition_and_fees_2013_14, Living_Cost_Off_Campus_Without_Family, Living_Cost_Off_Campus_With_Family
from Get_the_fees JOIN enrollments_2013 on (Get_the_fees.institution_name = enrollments_2013.institution_name);


4. Perform arithmetic operation to take out the gross total of expenses and store the result in new table:
CREATE TABLE Final_Table_1 row format delimited fields terminated by ',' STORED AS RCFile 
AS select institution_name,State, (drvef2013_total_enrollment * drvic2013_rv_tuition_and_fees_2013_14) AS Total_fees, 
(Living_Cost_on_Campus + Living_Cost_Off_Campus_Without_Family + Living_Cost_Off_Campus_With_Family) 
AS Other_Expenses from fees;

5. Query to analyze the reason for high revenue in top revenue generating states: 
CREATE TABLE Institution_category ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS RCFILE AS SELECT Get_the_fees. unitid, enrollments_2013.institution_name, Get_the_fees.state, enrollments_2013.drvef2013_total_enrollment, enrollments_2013.hd2013_Institution_size_category from
Get_the_fees JOIN enrollments_2013 on (Get_the_fees.institution_name = enrollments_2013.institution_name);
Execute below query once above table is created:
SELECT state, count(institution_name), hd2013_Institution_size_category from Institution_category
GROUP BY state, HD2013_Institution_size_category;
The result will give number of distinct institution categories in all the states and thus if the state have more number of institution falling under high fees category it will be more revenue generating state.

6.  Now your data is analysed and you can take out the total earnings from each state just by passing the below query in your ipython notebook through input.sql file. The output of it will be new table from where we can do simple select * from table_name and download all the data using HUE. this downloaded file will be used for visualization purpose of data.
select state, sum(Total_fees) AS Total_earning_from_Fees, sum(Other_Expenses) AS Total_Earning_from_Other from Final_table_1 GROUP BY state; --Run this in input.sql file in ipython notebook.
